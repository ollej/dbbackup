Usage
=====
Edit the file and change the parameters to the DbBackup constructor:

    $backup = new DbBackup("dbuser", "dbpassword", "dbname", 'secret', "/server/path/to/backups", "localhost", "your_email_address@example.com", DbBackup::COMPRESS_BZIP);

Upload the script to your web account.

Point your browser to the URL of the script, with your password as a parameter:

    http://www.example.com/dbbackup.php?pass=secret

Compression
===========

If you want the backup file to be compressed, use either DbBackup::COMPRESS_BZIP for 
bzip2 compression, or DbBackup::COMPRESS_GZIP for gzip compression. Otherwise the dump 
file will be saved in plain text.
